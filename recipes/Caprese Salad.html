    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>
      Caprese salad is a simple and refreshing Italian salad that showcases the
      flavors of ripe tomatoes, fresh mozzarella cheese, and fragrant basil
      leaves. It is named after the island of Capri in Italy and is a popular
      dish in Italian cuisine. The salad is typically composed of thick slices
      of juicy tomatoes, slices of creamy mozzarella cheese, and whole basil
      leaves arranged in a visually appealing manner. The salad is then drizzled
      with extra-virgin olive oil, sprinkled with a pinch of salt, and sometimes
      dressed with a splash of balsamic vinegar. Caprese salad is a celebration
      of fresh and vibrant ingredients, highlighting the natural sweetness of
      tomatoes, the smoothness of mozzarella, and the aromatic essence of basil.
      It is a light and delightful appetizer or side dish that captures the
      essence of Mediterranean flavors.
