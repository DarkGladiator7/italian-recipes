    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>
      Osso Buco is a traditional Italian dish that originates from Milan. The
      name "Osso Buco" means "bone with a hole" in Italian, referring to the
      marrow-filled bone that is a distinctive feature of the dish. The
      centerpiece of Osso Buco is a braised veal shank that is slow-cooked until
      tender and flavorful. The veal shanks are typically cross-cut, resulting
      in a round piece of meat with a marrow bone in the center. The dish is
      cooked in a combination of white wine, broth, and aromatic vegetables like
      onions, carrots, and celery. The long, slow cooking process allows the
      meat to become incredibly tender and the marrow to melt into the sauce,
      adding richness and depth of flavor. The dish is often seasoned with herbs
      such as bay leaves, thyme, and rosemary, and finished with a gremolata, a
      mixture of finely chopped garlic, lemon zest, and parsley, which adds a
      burst of freshness and a hint of citrus. Osso Buco is traditionally served
      with a side of risotto alla Milanese, a creamy saffron-infused rice dish,
      which pairs perfectly with the rich flavors of the meat. The combination
      of tender meat, flavorful sauce, and aromatic gremolata makes Osso Buco a
      beloved and comforting dish in Italian cuisine.
