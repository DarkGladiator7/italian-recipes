    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>
      Lasagna is a classic Italian dish known for its layers of pasta sheets,
      rich tomato sauce, cheese, and various fillings. It is a baked casserole
      that combines flavors and textures to create a hearty and satisfying meal.
      Traditionally, lasagna is made with alternating layers of pasta, meat
      sauce, and cheese, typically mozzarella and ricotta. However, there are
      countless variations available, including vegetarian and vegan options.
      The dish is often seasoned with herbs like oregano and basil, giving it a
      distinct Italian flavor. Once assembled, lasagna is baked in the oven
      until the pasta is tender and the cheese is melted and golden brown. It is
      a beloved comfort food enjoyed by people around the world.
